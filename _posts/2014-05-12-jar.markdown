Our paper **Implementing and reasoning about hash-consed data
structures in Coq**, Thomas Braibant, Jacques-Henri Jourdan and [David
Monniaux](http://www-verimag.imag.fr/~monniaux/) has been accepted for
publication in JAR. Latest draft avalaible 
[here]({{site.url}}/assets/pdf/jar-2014.pdf). The code is available
[here](https://github.com/braibant/hash-consing-coq).

# Abstract

We report on four different approaches to implementing hash-consing in
Coq programs. The use cases include execution inside Coq, or execution
of the extracted OCaml code. We explore the different trade-offs
between faithful use of pristine extracted code, and code that is
fine-tuned to make use of OCaml programming constructs not available
in Coq. We discuss the possible consequences in terms of performances
and guarantees.  We use the running example of binary decision
diagrams and then demonstrate the generality of our solutions by
applying them to other examples of hash-consed data structures.
