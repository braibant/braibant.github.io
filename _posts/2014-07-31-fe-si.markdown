title:  "Unarchiving Fe-Si: formally verified hardware synthesis in Coq."

[Adam Chlipala](http://adam.chlipala.net/) just pointed me out that
the source code for our joint paper at CAV 2013 was not available
anymore on the web. This is due to the fact that my old web-page at
Inria was removed. So, I am delighted to take this as an opportunity
to make the Fe-Si git repository available on github!

Fe-Si is a simplified version of Bluespec, an hardware description
language based on a notion of *guarded atomic actions*. Fe-Si is
defined as a dependently typed deep embedding in Coq. It comes with a
compiler whose target corresponds to a synthesisable subset of Verilog
or VHDL. A key aspect of our approach is that input programs for the
compiler can be defined and proved correct inside Coq. Then, we use
extraction and a Verilog backend (written in OCaml) to generate a
certified version of an hardware design.

You can find more in our CAV paper
([.pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.4779v1)) or in the git repository of
the project ([.git](https://github.com/braibant/Synthesis)).
